2. Add the following content:
```YAML
---
base_image: rhel
ci_tools: false
rhos_release_repo_url: http://xxxxxx
proxy_host: xx.yy.zz.aa:PORT
undercloud_sample: /usr/share/instack-undercloud/undercloud.conf.sample
# Set up container things
rhos_containers_registry: <some address>
container_registry_ip: <some IP>
```
3. Run the playbook with the following options:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml -t lab -e @local_env/patch.yaml
```

Notes:
- The ```proxy_host``` is discussed in this [blog post](https://cjeanner.github.io/openstack/tripleo/2018/08/07/accessing-private-stuff.html)
- The ```rhos_release``` stuff is internal to Red Hat
- This will not take into account any registration to RHEL
- The ```undercloud_sample``` is mandatory as long as instack-undercloud is used.
